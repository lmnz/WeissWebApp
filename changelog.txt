- Created a main page with a logo at the top (as of now, it's Claptrap as a placeholder) and buttons beneath it
- Changed the random card output page to have the "Random Card" button at top instead of below card information. This way, it stops moving up and down all the time
- Changed the card number search page to simply load the card information underneath it dynamically. I took a leaf from CS144's book and realized that the option to do another search should come bundled with the output
- Created basic advanced search functionality

<b>EASY:</b>
- Implement SQLite indexing upon database initialization
- Complete app settings page (easy because I don't envision very many settings for it atm)
- Make the current images more fitting (Claptrap) and not ugly (home button)

<b>MEDIUM:</b>
- Basic rules functionality (segment rulebook into text views and makes it browse-able)
- Basic game-tracking functionality
	- Basic chance functionalities to go with game stuff (die rolls, coin flips, etc)

<b>HARD:</b>
- Event support. Click a button and get a list of all nearby Weiss events
- User account/cloud stuff. Let users associate decklists, card inventories, etc with their name
- Identify cards by pictures (so Simon and I's old reverse image search idea)
